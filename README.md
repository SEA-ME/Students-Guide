3. **Sprint Duration:**
    * The ideal duration of a sprint is based on the complexity of the tasks and the availability of team members.
    * Sprint durations typically range from two to four weeks. **We will have two weeks.**
    * Consider factors like coursework load, project deadlines, and personal commitments when deciding the sprint duration.
4. **Daily Stand-up Meetings:**
    * Conduct regular stand-up meetings with your study team to stay aligned and track progress.
    * Keep the meetings brief and focused on sharing updates, discussing challenges, and planning the day's activities.
    * Address any impediments or issues that might hinder progress and find solutions collaboratively. Our Learning Facilitators staff is always available to help you find a way.
5. **Task Management and Tracking:**
    * Use **GitHub Projects** to manage and track tasks.
    * Create a visual representation of the project board with columns like "To-do," "In Progress," and "Completed."
    * Assign tasks to team members, set deadlines, and update the status of tasks regularly.
    * Monitor the progress of tasks and adapt the plan if necessary.
6. **Sprint Review:**
    * At the end of each sprint, we hold a sprint review meeting with your study team.
    * Demonstrate the completed tasks, discuss the challenges faced, and share lessons learned.
    * Reflect on the overall progress made during the sprint and **celebrate achievements.**
    * Collect feedback from team members and identify areas for improvement in the upcoming sprints.
